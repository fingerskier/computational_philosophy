Modal logic is a fascinating branch of logic that deals with statements involving necessity, possibility, and related concepts.


Basic Modal Operators:
1. □ (Box/Necessity): "It is necessarily true that..."
2. ◇ (Diamond/Possibility): "It is possibly true that..."

Key relationships:
- □p ≡ ¬◇¬p (Something is necessary if it's not possible for it to be false)
- ◇p ≡ ¬□¬p (Something is possible if it's not necessarily false)

Applications in different domains:

1. Epistemic Logic (Knowledge):
- □ becomes K ("knows that")
- "Kp" means "agent knows p"
- Example: If Kp (Alice knows p), then p must be true (knowledge is factual)

2. Deontic Logic (Obligation):
- □ becomes O ("ought to")
- "Op" means "it is obligatory that p"
- Example: O(pay_taxes) means "one ought to pay taxes"

3. Temporal Logic:
- □ becomes G ("always in the future")
- ◇ becomes F ("sometime in the future")
- Example: G(sun_rises) means "the sun will always rise"

4. Alethic Logic (Necessary Truth):
- Used for mathematical or logical truths
- Example: □(2+2=4) means "it is necessarily true that 2+2=4"
