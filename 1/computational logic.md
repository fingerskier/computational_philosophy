Computational logic is the use of logic (mathematical reasoning) for computation and programming. It combines principles from mathematical logic with computational techniques to solve problems algorithmically. Here are the key aspects:

1. Core Components:
- Propositional Logic: Deals with true/false statements
- Predicate Logic: Extends propositional logic with variables and quantifiers
- Boolean Algebra: Mathematical structure dealing with true/false values
- Formal Proofs: Systematic methods to verify logical statements

2. Main Applications:
- Program Verification: Proving programs work correctly
- Automated Reasoning: Using computers to prove theorems
- Logic Programming: Languages like Prolog
- Hardware Design: Digital circuit design using Boolean logic
