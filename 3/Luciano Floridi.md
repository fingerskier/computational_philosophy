# Luciano Floridi (1964-)

## Information Philosophy

Luciano Floridi is an Italian philosopher known for developing the Philosophy of Information (PI) as a distinct field of research. His work bridges philosophy, information science, computer ethics, and epistemology, offering novel frameworks for understanding information, knowledge, reality, and ethics in the digital age.

## The Philosophy of Information

### Core Thesis
Information is not just a useful concept but a fundamental category for understanding:
- Reality (metaphysics)
- Knowledge (epistemology)
- Ethics (moral philosophy)
- Agency (philosophy of mind and action)

### Information as Semantic Content

Floridi defines information as:
- **Well-formed** (syntactically correct)
- **Meaningful** (semantically significant)
- **Truthful** data (corresponding to reality)

**Formula**: Information = data + meaning + truth

This excludes:
- Misinformation (meaningful but false)
- Disinformation (deliberately false)
- Mere data (lacks semantic content)

## The Informational Turn

### Historical Context
Philosophy has undergone several major "turns":
- **Linguistic Turn** (early 20th century): Focus on language and meaning
- **Computational Turn** (mid-20th century): Mind as information processor
- **Informational Turn** (21st century): Information as fundamental category

### Implications
- Information becomes the primary lens for philosophical analysis
- Transforms traditional philosophical problems
- Provides new tools for understanding digital phenomena

## Informational Structural Realism

### The Method of Levels of Abstraction (LoA)

**Key Idea**: Analysis of any system requires specifying a Level of Abstraction

Components:
1. **Observables**: What features are relevant at this level
2. **Behaviors**: What operations/interactions are possible
3. **Gradients**: Degree of detail/precision

**Example**: Water
- Chemical LoA: H₂O molecules, bonding
- Macroscopic LoA: Liquid, freezing point, viscosity
- Informational LoA: Data carrier, computation medium

### Informational Ontology

Reality consists of:
- **Informational structures**
- **Patterns and relationships**
- **Differences that make a difference**

Not committed to specific substrate (matter, energy, information) but emphasizes:
- Relational properties
- Structural organization
- Information patterns

## The Infosphere

### Concept
The infosphere is:
- The totality of information environments
- Both digital and analog information spaces
- The ecosystem where informational entities exist and interact

### Components
1. **Documents**: Books, databases, websites, etc.
2. **Agents**: Humans, organizations, software agents
3. **Events**: Transactions, communications, processes
4. **Resources**: Knowledge, data, computational power

### Ecology of Information
- Informational pollution
- Information overload
- Sustainability of informational resources
- Rights and responsibilities in the infosphere

## Information Ethics (IE)

### Beyond Traditional Ethics

**Traditional computer ethics**: Focus on human users
- Privacy
- Intellectual property
- Access to information

**Information Ethics**: Expands moral consideration to the entire infosphere

### The Ontocentric Approach

**Central Principle**: Every informational entity has minimal moral worth

Not just:
- Humans
- Animals
- Ecosystems

But also:
- Data structures
- Informational patterns
- Digital entities

### Moral Actions in IE

**Evil**: Entropy, destruction of information
**Good**: Flourishing, enrichment of the infosphere

Actions are evaluated based on their impact on:
- Information quantity (creation vs. destruction)
- Information quality (enrichment vs. impoverishment)
- Information organization (order vs. chaos)

### Practical Applications

1. **Environmental Ethics**
   - Destruction of ecosystems = information loss
   - Biodiversity as informational richness

2. **Digital Ethics**
   - Deletion of data may have moral significance
   - Preservation of digital heritage
   - Responsible information creation

3. **AI Ethics**
   - Artificial agents as moral patients (recipients of moral consideration)
   - Duties toward informational entities
   - Respect for informational integrity

## Distributed Morality

### The Fourth Revolution

Floridi identifies four major "revolutions" that decentered humanity:

1. **Copernican**: Earth not center of universe
2. **Darwinian**: Humans not biologically special
3. **Freudian**: Consciousness not master of the mind
4. **Informational**: Humans not unique informational organisms

### Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)

Morality is distributed across:
- Human agents
- Artificial agents
- Hybrid systems
- Organizations

**Key insight**: Moral responsibility can be shared, delegated, or emergent in multi-agent systems.

### Design Ethics

Ethics must be:
- **Built-in** from the start, not added later
- **Embedded** in system architecture
- **Proactive** rather than reactive

"Ethics by design" vs. "Ethics by use"

## Semantic Information and Knowledge

### The Bar-Hillel-Carnap Paradox

Problem: More specific information = less probable = more informative

**Floridi's solution**: Distinguish:
- **Statistical information**: Probability-based
- **Semantic information**: Meaning-based, truth-conditional

### Strongly vs. Weakly Semantic Information

**Strongly semantic**: Truthful and meaningful
**Weakly semantic**: Meaningful (may be false)

Knowledge = strongly semantic information + additional conditions (e.g., justification)

## The Symbol Grounding Problem Revisited

### Floridi's Approach

Rather than asking "How do symbols get meaning?" ask:
- "What level of abstraction are we working at?"
- "What informational relations exist?"
- "How are patterns connected?"

**Key insight**: Grounding is relative to a Level of Abstraction, not absolute.

## Artificial Intelligence and Consciousness

### The Chinese Room from an Informational Perspective

**Searle's mistake** (according to Floridi):
- Assumes meaning must be intrinsic
- Ignores informational relationships
- Misunderstands levels of abstraction

**Floridi's view**:
- Meaning is relational, not intrinsic
- The system as a whole can have semantic competence
- Understanding emerges at appropriate LoA

### AI and Moral Agency

**Levels of Agency**:

1. **Moral Agents**: Can be held morally accountable (humans, possibly advanced AI)
2. **Moral Patients**: Deserve moral consideration (animals, ecosystems, informational entities)
3. **Moral Actors**: Perform morally significant actions without accountability (simple robots, automated systems)

**Distributed Moral Action**: Complex systems involve multiple agents at multiple levels.

## The Onlife Manifesto

### Hyperconnected Reality

Modern life increasingly blurs:
- Online and offline
- Digital and analog
- Virtual and physical

We now live **"onlife"**: a seamless integration of online and offline existence.

### Implications

1. **Identity**: Multiple digital identities, continuous identity construction
2. **Privacy**: Rethinking boundaries between public and private
3. **Autonomy**: Agency in algorithmic environments
4. **Reality**: Virtual experiences as genuinely real

### Policy Recommendations

- Protect digital rights
- Ensure digital dignity
- Promote information literacy
- Foster sustainable infosphere

## Computational Philosophy and Philosophical Engineering

### Philosophy as Conceptual Engineering

Philosophers should:
- Design new concepts
- Refine existing frameworks
- Build theoretical models
- Engineer solutions to conceptual problems

### Computational Methods

Information philosophy enables:
- Formal modeling of philosophical problems
- Computational approaches to traditional questions
- Simulation of philosophical scenarios
- Quantitative analysis of concepts

## Major Contributions Summary

1. **Philosophy of Information**: Establishing PI as a field
2. **Levels of Abstraction**: Methodological tool
3. **Information Ethics**: Expanding moral consideration
4. **Informational Structural Realism**: Ontological framework
5. **Distributed Morality**: Ethics in multi-agent systems
6. **The Fourth Revolution**: Understanding human place in information age

## Criticisms and Debates

### Too Broad?
**Objection**: Information concept is so general it explains nothing specifically.

**Response**: Levels of Abstraction provide precision; generality is a feature, not a bug.

### Information vs. Physical?
**Objection**: Information is just a way of describing physical systems, not ontologically distinct.

**Response**: Informational structural realism doesn't deny physical reality but emphasizes structural/relational aspects.

### Moral Standing of Information?
**Objection**: Absurd to grant moral standing to data structures.

**Response**: Minimal moral worth doesn't mean equal worth; acknowledges information's role in value.
