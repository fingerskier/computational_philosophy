# Aaron Sloman (1936-)

## Computational Philosophy

Aaron Sloman is a British AI researcher and philosopher who has made fundamental contributions to understanding the architecture of mind, emotions, and cognition through computational methods. His work bridges philosophy, AI, cognitive science, and robotics, pioneering the use of computational models to address philosophical questions.

## The Computational Stance in Philosophy

### Philosophy as Design Science

Sloman argues philosophy should be:
- **Design-based**: Understanding by designing and building systems
- **Architecturally focused**: Studying different possible architectures for minds
- **Empirically grounded**: Constrained by facts about humans, animals, machines
- **Evolutionarily informed**: Considering how minds evolved

### Computational Philosophy vs. Philosophy of Computation

**Philosophy of Computation**: Traditional philosophy about computational concepts
- What is computation?
- What are algorithms?
- Philosophy applied to computing

**Computational Philosophy**: Using computation to do philosophy
- Building models to test philosophical theories
- Designing architectures to explore possibilities
- Using AI as a tool for philosophical investigation

**Sloman's focus**: The latter—using computational methods to address philosophical questions.

## Architecture-Based Motivation vs. State-Based Motivation

### The Problem with Traditional Theories

Traditional theories treat motivation as:
- Current internal states (desires, drives)
- External stimuli (rewards, punishments)
- Combinations of these

**Sloman's insight**: Much motivation comes from **architecture** itself, not current states.

### Architecture-Based Motivation

Built-in architectural features that:
- Generate goals automatically
- Respond to certain patterns
- Persist across state changes
- Don't require explicit representation

**Examples**:
- Infant's urge to explore
- Curiosity about novelty
- Drive to maintain consistency
- Social attachment patterns

**Implications**:
- Can't fully understand behavior from snapshots of internal states
- Need to understand underlying architecture
- Emotions and motivations are architectural, not just state-based

## The CogAff Architecture

### Cognitive-Affective Architecture

Sloman's framework for understanding minds:

### Three Layers (Vertical Decomposition)

1. **Reactive Layer**
   - Fast, automatic responses
   - Pattern-triggered actions
   - No deliberation or planning
   - Example: Reflexes, startle responses

2. **Deliberative Layer**
   - Reasoning and planning
   - Considers alternatives
   - Evaluates consequences
   - Example: Planning a trip, solving problems

3. **Meta-Management Layer**
   - Monitors and controls other layers
   - Reflects on processes
   - Modulates attention and priorities
   - Example: Self-awareness, executive control

### Three Subsystems (Horizontal Decomposition)

1. **Perception**: Processing sensory input
2. **Central Processing**: Reasoning, planning, decision-making
3. **Action**: Motor control and execution

**Key insight**: Real minds have both vertical (reactive/deliberative/meta-management) and horizontal (perception/central/action) organization.

## Emotions and AI

### The Emotion Machine

Emotions are not:
- Simple feelings or sensations
- Distinct modules in the brain
- Separate from cognition

Emotions are:
- **Complex architectural states**: Involving multiple subsystems
- **Control states**: Managing cognitive resources
- **Information processing modes**: Organizing perception and action

### Primary vs. Secondary Emotions

**Primary emotions**: Rapid, reactive, automatic
- Evolutionary ancient
- Shared with many animals
- Example: Startle, simple fear responses

**Secondary emotions**: Involve deliberation and reflection
- Require more complex architecture
- May be human-specific
- Example: Guilt, pride, sophisticated social emotions

**Tertiary emotions**: Meta-emotional states
- Emotions about emotions
- Require meta-management layer
- Example: Being ashamed of being proud

### Design-Based Analysis

To understand emotion:
1. What problems does it solve?
2. What architectural requirements does it have?
3. How might it be implemented?
4. What evolutionary pressures shaped it?

## The Space of Possible Minds

### Niche Relativity

Different environments require different cognitive architectures:
- **Physical environment**: Gravity, topology, resources
- **Social environment**: Conspecifics, communication, cooperation
- **Evolutionary history**: What ancestral creatures were like
- **Developmental trajectory**: Infant to adult changes

**Implications**:
- No single "optimal" mind design
- Human minds are one point in vast design space
- Aliens, animals, and future AI might be very different

### Design Space Exploration

Rather than asking "What is THE mind?", ask:
- What are possible mind architectures?
- What are their trade-offs?
- Which architectures suit which niches?
- How do architectures constrain capabilities?

## Perception and Action

### Active Vision

Vision is not:
- Passive reception of images
- Bottom-up processing only
- Construction of complete internal model

Vision is:
- **Active**: Eyes move, attention shifts
- **Selective**: Focus on relevant information
- **Constructive**: Builds partial representations
- **Action-oriented**: For guiding behavior

### Affordances

Following J.J. Gibson:
- Perception detects action possibilities
- Environment offers "affordances"
- Direct pickup of functional properties
- No need for complete world model

**Sloman's addition**: Different architectures detect different affordances based on their action capabilities.

## Development and Learning

### Epigenesis

Development involves:
- Gene-environment interaction
- Self-organizing processes
- Emergent capabilities
- Staged progression

**Not** just:
- Genetic programming
- Environmental shaping
- Simple learning mechanisms

### Bootstrapping Intelligence

Question: How do you get from simple infant to sophisticated adult?

**Sloman's approach**:
- Start with basic architecture
- Architecture enables learning
- Learning transforms architecture
- New architecture enables more learning

Virtuous cycle of development.

## Meta-Semantic Capabilities

### Beyond Language

Humans have special meta-semantic abilities:
- Think about thinking
- Represent representations
- Reason about reasoning
- Understand understanding

**Requirements**:
- Meta-management layer
- Self-monitoring capabilities
- Symbolic representation of mental states
- Reflective processes

**Implications for AI**:
- Need architectural support for meta-cognition
- Can't just add reflection to reactive systems
- Requires appropriate design from the start

## The Frame Problem Revisited

### Sloman's Analysis

Frame problem reveals:
- Limits of logical approaches
- Need for attention mechanisms
- Importance of architectural solutions
- Role of evolved competencies

### Architectural Solutions

Rather than trying to represent everything that doesn't change:
- Use architectural features to filter relevance
- Employ attention mechanisms
- Leverage domain-specific competencies
- Allow parallel specialized processes

**Key insight**: Frame problem is architectural, not just representational.

## Multi-Ontology Approach

### Different Levels of Description

Same system can be described using:
- **Physical ontology**: Atoms, forces, energy
- **Information-processing ontology**: Bits, algorithms, data structures
- **Intentional ontology**: Beliefs, desires, goals
- **Phenomenological ontology**: Experiences, qualia

**None is "more real"**: Each suited to different explanatory purposes.

### Virtual Machinery

High-level mental states are:
- Implemented in physical substrate
- But not reducible to it
- Have causal powers at their own level
- Constitute "virtual machinery"

**Analogy**: Software is real and has effects, even though it's implemented in hardware.

## Philosophical Implications

### Consciousness

**Sloman's approach**:
- Not a single thing to explain
- Different aspects (access, phenomenal, self-awareness)
- Each requires different architectural features
- Some aspects may be achievable in machines

### Free Will

- Architectural compatibilism
- Different layers of control
- Meta-management enables reflection
- "Could have done otherwise" is architecture-relative

### Personal Identity

- Not a simple continuity
- Multiple levels of organization
- Architectural persistence through change
- Narrative construction

## Critique of Philosophical Methodology

### Problems with Traditional Philosophy

1. **Armchair speculation**: Not empirically grounded
2. **Binary thinking**: Yes/no rather than design space exploration
3. **Verbal disputes**: Fighting over words rather than exploring mechanisms
4. **Oversimplification**: Ignoring architectural complexity

### Better Methodology

1. **Build models**: Test ideas through implementation
2. **Study designs**: Explore space of possibilities
3. **Interdisciplinary**: Integrate philosophy, AI, psychology, neuroscience
4. **Evolutionary perspective**: Consider how things evolved

## Contributions to AI

### AI Should Study Intelligence, Not Just Solve Problems

**Problem-solving focus**: Build systems that work
**Scientific focus**: Understand intelligence itself

**Sloman's advocacy**: AI should contribute to understanding minds, not just building tools.

### Architecture Matters

Can't just:
- Add more data
- Use bigger networks
- Train longer

Need to:
- Design appropriate architectures
- Understand architectural requirements
- Build systems with right structure

### Critique of Purely Statistical Approaches

Modern machine learning:
- **Strengths**: Pattern recognition, scaling, practical success
- **Limitations**: Lacks understanding, brittle, opaque, architecture-poor

**Need**: Hybrid approaches combining symbolic and statistical methods.

## Vision, Geometry, and Evolution

### The Evolution of Vision and Spatial Understanding

**Question**: How did spatial reasoning evolve?

**Sloman's research**:
- Mathematical/geometric competencies evolved in response to physical environment
- Pre-verbal spatial reasoning
- Foundation for later mathematical discoveries
- Explains why geometry seems "obvious"

### Meta-Configured Genomes

Genes don't fully specify brain architecture but:
- Provide architectural principles
- Enable developmental processes
- Allow environmental tuning
- Support evolved competencies

## Comparison with Other Approaches

### vs. Symbolic AI
- **Agreement**: Representations and reasoning matter
- **Addition**: Need proper architecture, not just logic

### vs. Connectionism/Neural Networks
- **Agreement**: Parallel processing, learning important
- **Addition**: Need symbolic capabilities, deliberation, meta-management

### vs. Embodied Cognition
- **Agreement**: Embodiment and interaction matter
- **Addition**: Need internal complexity, not just sensorimotor loops

### vs. Computational Theory of Mind
- **Agreement**: Mind is computational
- **Refinement**: Need architectural richness, multiple forms of computation

## Contemporary Relevance

### Modern AI Systems

**GPT and LLMs**:
- Impressive but architecturally simple
- Lack deliberative layer
- No meta-management
- Missing motivational architecture

**Need**: More architecturally sophisticated systems

### Robotics

**Challenge**: Building robots that develop intelligence like children
- Need appropriate architectures
- Must support learning
- Should enable curiosity and exploration

### AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)

**Sloman's view**:
- Requires architectural sophistication
- Can't just scale up current approaches
- Need to understand architectural requirements
- Must support development and learning
