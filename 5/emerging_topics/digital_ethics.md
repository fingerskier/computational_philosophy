# Digital Ethics

## Overview

Digital ethics encompasses moral questions arising from digital technologies, including artificial intelligence, data science, social media, and emerging technologies. It extends traditional ethical frameworks to novel challenges posed by computational systems.

## Scope and Foundations

### Core Areas
- Information ethics
- Computer ethics
- AI ethics
- Data ethics
- Internet ethics
- Roboethics

### Theoretical Foundations
Digital ethics draws from:
- Consequentialism (outcomes and impacts)
- Deontology (duties and rights)
- Virtue ethics (character and practices)
- Care ethics (relationships and responsibility)

## Key Ethical Challenges

### Privacy and Surveillance

**Issues:**
- Erosion of privacy through data collection
- Surveillance capitalism
- Mass monitoring and its social effects

**Questions:**
- What privacy expectations are reasonable in digital contexts?
- How do we balance security and privacy?
- Who owns personal data?

### Autonomy and Manipulation

**Issues:**
- Persuasive technology and dark patterns
- Filter bubbles and echo chambers
- Addiction by design
- Behavioral modification

**Questions:**
- When does influence become manipulation?
- What are legitimate uses of persuasive technology?
- How do we preserve meaningful choice?

### Responsibility and Accountability

**Issues:**
- Distributed responsibility in complex systems
- Automation and deskilling
- Algorithmic decision-making
- Moral agency of artificial systems

**Questions:**
- Who is responsible for algorithmic harms?
- Can artificial systems be moral agents?
- How do we attribute responsibility in socio-technical systems?

### Justice and Fairness

**Issues:**
- Digital divide and access inequalities
- Algorithmic discrimination
- Platform power and monopolization
- Labor conditions in technology sector

**Questions:**
- What constitutes digital justice?
- How should digital resources be distributed?
- What are appropriate regulations for platform power?
