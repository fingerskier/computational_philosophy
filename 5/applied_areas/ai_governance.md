## Regulatory Approaches

### Risk-Based Regulation
Tailoring requirements to risk levels (e.g., EU AI Act)

**Advantages:**
- Proportionate to actual risks
- Flexible across use cases
- Resource efficiency

**Challenges:**
- Defining risk categories
- Gaming and category manipulation
- Dynamic risk assessment

### Sector-Specific Regulation
Domain-tailored rules (healthcare, finance, etc.)

**Advantages:**
- Context-appropriate
- Builds on existing frameworks
- Domain expertise

**Challenges:**
- Gaps and inconsistencies
- Fragmentation
- Regulatory arbitrage

### Principles-Based Regulation
High-level principles rather than detailed rules

**Advantages:**
- Flexibility and adaptability
- Technology-neutral
- Encourages innovation

**Challenges:**
- Vagueness and uncertainty
- Inconsistent interpretation
- Limited enforceability

### Adaptive Governance
Iterative, learning-oriented approaches

**Features:**
- Regular review and updates
- Experimentation (sandboxes)
- Stakeholder feedback
- Evidence-based adjustment

## Key Policy Issues
