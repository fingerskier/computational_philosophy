# Computational Philosophy: A Structured Learning Path

## 0. Introductory Mindspace

### Meaning
- Author's meaning vs symbol's meaning
- Explore the changed meaning of tokens in/out of context: word, phrase, sentence, paragraph, chapter, book
- this sentence means I should eat my vegetables

### Understanding 
- Can we translate or interpret without understanding
- Chinese room
- The author of the translation books had understanding, can it not be passed on

### Wisdom
- Black & White Mary
- Is there more to experience than knowledge? 
- Would we even know our first color at first sight by knowledge alone?
