# Section 4: Research Methodologies

This section explores the methodologies used in computational philosophy research, bridging both computational and traditional philosophical approaches.

## Overview

Research in computational philosophy employs a diverse array of methods, drawing from both computer science and philosophy. Understanding these methodologies is crucial for conducting rigorous research and evaluating claims in the field.

## Subsections

### [Computational Methods](./computational_methods/)

Explore how computational techniques are applied to philosophical problems:

- [Agent-Based Modeling](./computational_methods/agent_based_modeling.md) - Simulating autonomous agents to study emergent behaviors
- [Neural Network Modeling](./computational_methods/neural_network_modeling.md) - Using artificial neural networks to model cognition
- [Formal Methods](./computational_methods/formal_methods.md) - Mathematical approaches to specification and verification
- [Simulation Studies](./computational_methods/simulation_studies.md) - Computer simulations for philosophical inquiry

### [Philosophical Methods](./philosophical_methods/)

Traditional philosophical methods applied to computational questions:

- [Thought Experiments](./philosophical_methods/thought_experiments.md) - Conceptual scenarios for testing intuitions
- [Logical Analysis](./philosophical_methods/logical_analysis.md) - Formal logical reasoning and argumentation
- [Conceptual Analysis](./philosophical_methods/conceptual_analysis.md) - Clarifying and analyzing concepts
- [Empirical Philosophy](./philosophical_methods/empirical_philosophy.md) - Incorporating empirical data into philosophy

## Integration

The most powerful research often combines computational and philosophical methods, using each to inform and strengthen the other. This section demonstrates how these methodologies complement each other in advancing our understanding of computational philosophy.
