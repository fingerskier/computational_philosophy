# Conceptual Analysis

## Overview

Conceptual analysis is the philosophical method of clarifying and analyzing concepts by examining their constituent parts, necessary conditions, and relationships. In computational philosophy, conceptual analysis helps us understand fundamental notions like computation, information, intelligence, and consciousness.
