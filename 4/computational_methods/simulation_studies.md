# Simulation Studies

## Overview

Simulation studies use computational models to recreate phenomena and test hypotheses in controlled virtual environments. In philosophy, simulations offer a unique methodology for exploring thought experiments, testing theories, and investigating complex systems that would be impractical or impossible to study empirically.
