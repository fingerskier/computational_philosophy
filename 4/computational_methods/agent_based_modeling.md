# Agent-Based Modeling

## Overview

Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a computational methodology that simulates the actions and interactions of autonomous agents to assess their effects on the system as a whole. In computational philosophy, ABM provides a powerful tool for exploring complex philosophical questions about emergence, social behavior, and collective phenomena.
