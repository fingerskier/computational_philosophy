The symbol grounding problem is a fundamental challenge in cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and philosophy of mind. It asks how symbols (like words or internal representations) acquire meaning and connect to the real-world things they represent.

To illustrate: Imagine trying to learn Chinese using only a Chinese-Chinese dictionary. You look up one symbol, but its definition contains more Chinese symbols, which you then need to look up, leading to an endless loop of symbols referring to other symbols without ever connecting to actual meaning. This is similar to how computers process symbols - they can manipulate them according to rules, but how do these symbols become meaningful rather than just arbitrary tokens?

Philosopher Stevan Harnad formally introduced this problem in 1990, arguing that for true understanding, symbols need to be "grounded" in non-symbolic representations derived from direct experience with the world - like sensory perceptions and interactions.

The problem raises important questions for AI development, like:
- Can AI systems truly understand language without sensorimotor experience?
- Is symbolic manipulation sufficient for genuine understanding?
- What role does embodiment play in developing meaningful representations?
